# Trivia-Quiz-roject
This project is a Trivia Quiz built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. It presents a series of trivia questions to the user, allowing them to test their knowledge across various topics. The questions are stored in a list with dictionaries, making it easy to manage and display them in a user-friendly manner.

# Question Data List: 
The questions are organized in a list, where each question is represented as a dictionary. This dictionary contains three key-value pairs: "category" for the question's category, "question" for the question itself and "answer" for the correct answer.

# User Interaction: 
The program will present the questions one by one to the user. The user needs to provide their answer as input.

# Scoring System: 
The user's score will be tracked throughout the quiz. For each correct answer, the user's score will increase.

# Final Score Display: 
At the end of the quiz, the user's final score will be displayed, showing how well they performed.
